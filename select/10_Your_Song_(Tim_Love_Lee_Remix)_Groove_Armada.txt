Don't let them take it away
Mama Said
Keep it down, down, down
Put it away
How could I roam in the song (?)
When the words come and go

Every time I hear your song
You fade away
How I've tried for so, so long
Then you will stay

Now nobody can see
See what it means
What it means to you
To me and I

Don't let it fade away
Fade away
To the other side
Oh yesterday

Every time I hear your song
You fade away
How I've tried for so, so long
Then you will stay

Every time I hear your song
Every time, every time
Your song
